  <h1 id="uidesign">Sprint 1</h1>
<p>This was our first sprint where we were introduced to our project and the expectations of our project.</p>

<h4>What was done?</h4>
<p>For this sprint, we were required to start a web application.</p>
<p>We were to add basic functionality such as registering an account, adding a game and viewing games that had been added</p>

<h4>What I did</h4>
<p>During this sprint, I did basic things like creating views, editing HTML so we could view content, and adding functions to our controllers, like a create and store function for our games controller.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of our team and the lack of natural English speakers, I stood up and helped write all our User Stories for this sprint. With me being a natural English speaker, it made this proccess quicker and more efficient.</p>
<p>I also needed to fix a database MYSQL error, regarding a default string length.</p>
<p>During this sprint, our team had 4 stand up meetings, I attended all of these.</p>


<h4>Personal achievements</h4>
<p>During this Sprint, I was in the very beggining stages of learning Laravel. I knew nothing about how the MVC model worked.</p>
<p>Through my own research online, I was able to get a better understanding of Laravel, particularly models, controllers and functions.</p>
<p>When I couldn't figure something out and I couldn't find it online, I would ask our scrum master if he was able to help and provide guidance.</p>

<h4>Technical achievements</h4>
<p>During this sprint, one team member added a lot of temporary files, deleting our .env and .gitignore file.</p>
<p>With the help of Elise and the other team members, we were able to figure where the issue went wrong, and worked out how to fix it.</p>
<p>I was not really part of fixing the issue, but I worked with my team during this issue, providing advice, listening and learning on the way.</p>
<p>This showed me the importance of working with a team through issues, and I learnt how to revert changes and I learnt what importance the .env and .gitignore files had.</p>


<h4>Was I agile? How? How not?</h4>
<p>During this sprint, I feel I showed some principles of being agile, but overall, I was not agile.</p>
<p>I was agile in the way I worked with the team. We had stand-up meetings, although not as many as we should have.</p>
<p>We produced software with basic functionality, it was working and we achieved our goals.</p>
<p>We did not regularly reflect on our work, only during the end of our sprint.</p>
<p>I feel I could have taken on more technically challenging work, and more of it. Being inexperienced at Laravel, I was scared of taking the risk of doing more challenging tasks as I didn't want to
  make our team fall behind by attempting to do more than I was capable of at the time.</p>
<p>I didn't work at a continuous pace. Some days I would do more work, some days less, some days none at all.</p>

<h4>Sprint conclusion</h4>
<p>During this sprint, I was not agile, though me and my team showed understanding of some agile principles.</p>
<p>I felt I was valuable to my team in that I created User Stories and completed work that I undertook.</p>
<p>I feel I could have been more valuable by taking on more challenges.</p>
<p>Our Sprint Restrospective showed that we needed to have more scrum meetings, communicate better and divide tasks based on what people were good at.</p>
<p>During this sprint, I learnt about what it means to be agile. I learnt more about Laravel and Git, how they function and how to use them together.</p>
<p>I learnt how we should be working as a team, what team work can achieve, and learnt how to be more efficient as a team member for the future.</p>

<h1>Sprint 2</h1>

<h4>What was done?</h4>

<p>For this sprint, we added more functionality to our website, and also made so design changes.</p>
<p>We were to add searching of games to our website, add game details which could be viewed from our list of games, and make a more responsive, better looking website.</p>
<p>This was also the first time we met face to face with our client, Hymie, who was able to describe in more depth to us, what he was after.</p>

<h4>What I did</h4>
<p>During this sprint I was put in charge of design of the website, adding navigation and adding a colour scheme.</p>
<p>This was not a very challenging job, but one I felt comfortable doing. Looking back, I definitely could have taken on something more challenging.</p>
<p>During this sprint, our team increased stand up meetings from 4 to 6. This was an improvement, and improved our communication, but we still felt we needed more.</p>

<h4>Personal achievements</h4>
<p>During this sprint, we had our first chance to communicate with our client.</p>
<p>During some times, I found communicating with our client difficult. I tried communicating with the client regarding an appropriate colour scheme, and in response, got a link to a website with 50 nice colour schemes.</p>
<p>While this was good, it didn't help me in knowing what the client was after.</p>
<p>I had to be persistant in asking what colour schemes the client was interested in, while proposing ideas.</p>
<p>After some back and forwards conversation, we were able to decide on a colour scheme, while sizing, design decisions, fonts etc were left up to me to decide.</p>
<p>I found it difficult to communicate with the client during this time, sometimes not hearing back for a few days, but being persistant in conjunction with my own research, we were able to decide on an appropriate colour scheme.</p>

<h4>Technical achievements</h4>
<p>During this sprint,I feel there wasn't many technical achievements or difficulties I came across.</p>
<p>This is mainly due to me not taking on a very technically challenging task, and keeping well within my comfort zone</p>
<p>I did have the challenge of working with such a big Bootstrap css file, this made finding styling elements I wanted to change difficult. I needed to search a lot and change elements and revert changes until I found it changed what I wanted.</p>

<h4>Was I agile? How? How not?</h4>
<p>During this sprint, I feel I showed some principles of being agile, but overall, I was not agile.</p>
<p>I did not take on challenging enough tasks where I felt satisfied I had helped the team enough.</p>
<p>As a team, our communication was better across the board, using the platform Microsoft Teams to communicate within our group and to our client.</p>
<p>We increased stand up meetings, which helped us know where we all were, and if anyone needed help.</p>
<p>When we had our sprint meeting with our client, although he was happy with my design, he felt it could be improved, which I worked on during the next sprint. This can fall within the agile principle of working software. Although the client
  was happy with what I produced, it could have been better.</p>
<p>Overall, I didn't feel like I was agile during this sprint. I need to increase my workload and technical challenges, but I felt I communicated well to my team and to the client.</p>


<h4>Sprint conclusion</h4>
<p>During this sprint, I was not agile, though me and my team showed understanding of some agile principles.</p>
<p>As a whole, our team didn't take on many challenging tasks during this sprint, but I found that I especially didn't.</p>
<p>I took on the role of doing design as I felt it was easy and not challenging. At this stage, I was still reluctant to challenge myself and take on a difficult challenge.</p>
<p>Our communication as a team improved this sprint, with more stand up meetings, and more communication using Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>Our sprint meeting with our client went well, he was happy with what we produced, which was working software, although he did note my design could be better.</p>
<p>During this sprint, I realised the effectiveness of good communication. It was easier to communicate, and easier to know where everyone was in terms of progress and what was expected of us.</p>
<p>We found the amount of stand up meetings we had was good, an improvement on last sprint, but still we could do more which could benefit us.</p>
<p>I started to realise from this sprint, that I needed to take on more challenging tasks to be an effective team member. I started realising others were doing more than me, also in a technical aspect, and I needed to take on the challenge to feel more satisfied.</p>
