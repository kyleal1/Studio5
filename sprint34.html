  <h4>What was done?</h4><hr>
<p>For this sprint, our team was to work on the design of our website, add a controller for scores so we can add, update, delete and edit scores and list all of the users.</p>
<p>My job for this sprint was to continue working on the design, creating something our client would like even better than what I showed him last sprint.
  
  <h4>What I did</h4><hr>
  <p>During this sprint, I took on the task of improving our website design after receiving feedback from our client.</p>
  <p>This was not challenging and I should have done more during this sprint.</p>
  <p>I did about the same amount of work as last sprint, but less technical as I knew what I was doing.</p>
  <p>Although after presenting the work done from this sprint, to our client, he was very pleased with our design and had no criticism.</p>
  
  
  <h4>Personal achievements</h4><hr>
  <p>During this Sprint, I felt I was able to take on board the criticism I received during our last sprint meeting with our client</p>
  <p>I knew exactly what he wanted, and followed advice he gave me. I found that this was me learning from mistakes, taking on criticsm and working towards a solution.</p>
  
  <h4>Technical achievements</h4><hr>
  <p>During this sprint, I learnt what branching was and used branching instead of merging all my work to the master branch straight away.</p>
  <p>This was good as it meant we could all do our own work, without cluttering our master branch.</p>
  <p>I don't feel like I came across any other technical challenges or achievements during this sprint, I did not do enough work.</p>
  
  
  <h4>Was I agile? How? How not?</h4><hr>
  <p>I was not agile during this sprint.</p>
  <p>Our stand up meetings increased once again from 6 to 8, this shows our team are learning to be more agile, but I think as an individual, I didn't do enough to say I was being agile.</p>
  <p>Communication was better this sprint, but a combination of not enough work, not enough technical and not enough challenging work makes me feel I was not agile like the rest of my team</p>
  <p>Although I was not agile, I attended all stand up meetings, and communicated well within my team, offering advice and ideas where I could.</p>
  
  <h4>Sprint conclusion</h4><hr>
  <p>During this sprint, I was not agile.</p>
  <p>This was one of my worst sprints, where I simply did not take on a big enough workload and didn't challenge myself.</p>
  <p>I realised this, and during our sprint restrospective meeting, I suggested I take on more challenging tasks from now on.</p>
  <p>I felt I listened to the client well regarding criticism from our last sprint meeting, and produced something he was happy with.</p>
  <p>I learnt from this sprint, I need to take on a much larger workload in order to feel part of the team and be a contributing member.</p>
  <p>Our communication was good, stand up meetings were good, slightly better planning needed on tasks, I felt we were all working towards being more agile, but still room for improvement.</p>

<h1>Sprint 4</h1>
<br>
<h4>What was done?</h4><hr>
<p>This was by far one of our best sprints in terms of productivity and being agile.</p>
<p>We were asked to create profiles, show what games are popular, add genres, sort our data, add images and add a feature for disabling accounts.</p>
<p>During this sprint, I was asked to add genres, and add a popular games column which showed which games were the most popular.</p>
<p>For me, this was a lot more technically challenging as I hadn't done a full stack developement yet, and had lots to learn but was confident in taking on the task.</p>

  
  <h4>What I did</h4><hr>
  <p>During this sprint, I took on the task of adding genres and adding a popular games column on our home page.</p>
  <p>Adding the genres was a full stack developement, where I created a model, controller, migration and database seeder class.
    This was by far the most challenging task I had taken on, but I was confident as I had learnt a lot along the way, was willing to learn more and wanted something technically challenging.</p>
    <p>I had to create a model, migration and table. The model had the relationship that a genre can have many games and a game can have one genre.
      I then had to add a foreign key constraint, seed the database, edit the views and controllers, and then test the new feature.</p>
    <p>The other task I took on was adding popular games column. This meant I had to edit the view to add a column, add a query in the controller and then reference that in the view.</p>
    <p>The popular games query was of the count of individual scores added. The game with the most was the most popular. This was then sorted in descending order, so the most popular game was at the top.</p>
  
  
  <h4>Personal achievements</h4><hr>
  <p>During this Sprint, I felt I took on a much larger and difficult workload than before. This meant I was going to need to 
    focus more time and effort onto this sprint as to not let the team or myself down</p>
    <p>I had to watch tutorials and read websites to get a good grasp of what I was dealing with.</p>
    <p>At one point, I got stuck on how to create the query for the popular games. I went to our scrum master, Irving, who had difficulty too. We both researched and came up with a solution and appropriate query
      which achieved exactly what we wanted to achieve.</p>
  
  <h4>Technical achievements</h4><hr>
<p>Need to do.
  
  
  <h4>Was I agile? How? How not?</h4><hr>
  <p>Yes, I felt during this sprint, both my team and myself were very agile.</p>
  <p>I myself, took on a full stack developement, and achieved it within our sprint time. I felt I did a sufficient amount of work this sprint, and felt like the amount of work I did this sprint, I should have been doing every sprint.</p>
  <p>Our team had 7 stand up meetings which I attended all. We chose 7 as last sprint we found 8 was too many and we were repeating information, but the 6 we'd done in a prior sprint wasn't enough. 7 was a good number for our team.</p>
  <p>I found we followed most agile principles. We had regular stand up meetings, we paid attention to technical excellence, we produced valuable, working software, we worked together and communicated effectively,
    we motivated and encouraged each other to take on a good workload, but most of all, our customer was extremely happy with what we produced, he had no complaints at all.</p>
  
  
  <h4>Sprint conclusion</h4><hr>
  <p>During this sprint, I was agile.</p>
  <p>I had learnt what it was like to effectively work as a team. Taking in all the criticism, learning from previous failiures, learning agile priciples and applying them.</p>
  <p>I challenged myself and accomplished my goals. I took on an appropriate workload with a good level of difficulty.</p>
  <p>What was most important, was I had learnt what I needed to do to be agile, from my previous sprints. I felt like the team appreciated my efforts.</p>
  <p>Our communication was good. We were all asking for help when needed, including myself. I offered advice and got offered advice.</p>
  <p>A combination of challenging ourselves appropriately, listening to our client, listening to each other, communicating with each other and putting in the time and effort, resulted in a good, agile sprint.</p>
<p>Our client was very happy with what was presented. We were working effectively, using branching, merging to master, merging to our deployment server, all within the given amount of time.</p>
<p>One thing we could have done better was communicated with our client more during our sprint, although I feel we communicated effectively at our sprint meetings to where this wasn't neccessary.</p>
