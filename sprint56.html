        <h4>What was done?</h4>
        <p>This was our final sprint before presenting our final production website.</p>
        <p>This sprint was about bettering our users experience, fixing any bugs we found while testing functionality, and increasing security.</p>
        
        <h4>What I did</h4>
        <p>During this sprint, I chose to work on increasing the security of our website by methods of sanitizing user input.</p>
        <p>I also added required fields, and added code where if a form was incorrectly filled out, old input was shown in the redirected page.</p>
        <p>Other smaller tasks included transversing our webpage, fixing any typos and making things more simplistic where possible.</p>
        
        <h4>Personal achievements</h4>
        ...
        
        <h4>Technical achievements</h4>
        <p>One technical challenge I had during this sprint, was having a git error when migrating my databases, because of a change another team member had made.
          To overcome this challenge, I went and asked the member who made the change, who advised me I simply needed to add a dependancy to my composer file and update composer.</p>
          <p>This demonstrated good communication to quickly and easily overcome an issue.</p>
        
        
        <h4>Was I agile? How? How not?</h4>
        <p>During this sprint, I feel like I was agile.</p>
        <p>I worked at a good, steady pace, I worked to my strengths to benefit the team, while taking the time to go above and beyond, testing features of the website.</p>
        <p>I did some tasks that were beyond my scope as per tasks that we given to us, and I also communicated different UI design ideas to the member of the team that was working on them, that I felt would make our website more usable.</p>
        <p>I accomplished all my tasks this sprint, testing my features, and felt the outcome was good.</p>
        <p>At the end of this sprint, we had a full, working production copy of our website, inclusive off all functionality that was asked, while keeping usablility and security in mind.</p>
        
        <h4>Sprint conclusion</h4>
        <p>During this sprint, I was agile, working well with my team, asking for help, offering help, offering ideas and taking in advice from others.</p>
        <p>The sprint went very smoothly, the team worked at a good pace, communication was good throughout, and tasks were finished on time.</p>
        <p>I took note of how I worked during my last sprint and tried to work the same, communicating well, taking on a good workload, taking on challenges, producing what our customer wanted, and making sure it functioned.</p>
        
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        
        
        <p>Over the period of 5 sprints, I learnt what the principles of agile were and what it meant to be agile.</p>
        <p>In the beginning, I wasn't an agile worker, but towards the end, particularly sprint 4 and 5, I felt I was agile, following many agile principles, displaying the traits of a good team member.</p>
        <p>In the beginning, my communication was not very good. I was not confident, did not want to take on challenges, and didn't care much for working software, as long as I was getting work done.</p>
        <p>In the end, I communicated regularly, and found regular stand up meetings was a good way of working with the team. I also communicated with team members using Microsoft Teams, as well as in and inbetween other classes.</p>
        <p>I took on a much larger workload towards the end. I did lots of self directed learning, particularly about Laravel and MVC models and how they interacted. This helped me get tasks done as it was the base of our website.</p>
        <p>I learnt more about databases and how they worked and I took on challenges which required me to do self-directed learning to achieve them. The pressure of that, along with the pressure of helping the team made me work harder to accomplish tasks.</p>
        <p>In the beginning, I feel I wouldn't achieve what I had achieved by the end of sprint 5. Learning agile principles and being agile helped me achieve these.</p>
